# SingSparrow
SingSparrow is software for operant conditioning. It allows the introduction of complex reinforcement schedules. SingSparrow is commonly used to train songbirds to sing.

SingSparrow comes in the following modes:

|Mode|Description|
|---|:---:|
|operant|Animal has control over which song to play after activating a given trigger.|
|operant-yoked|Animal elicits playback by activating triggers, but the animal does not have control over what songs are played after activating a given trigger. Rather, the order in which different types of song are played is the same as elicited by another animal, which used SingSparrow in operant mode.|
