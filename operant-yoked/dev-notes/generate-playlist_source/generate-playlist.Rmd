SingSparrow, in mode operant-yoked, needs to generate a playlist based on playbacks elicited by a different bird. This file documents the code used to generate that playlist.

## Import playbacks elicited by a different bird
Logs of keypresses for a different bird were read and playbacks were extracted using command line tools for reading text.

The program can determine the identity of the song from the filename and it appends that info to info on keypresses. I tested that this is true using a single file.

```{bash}
logdir="./testbird"

printf "The file for testing the command"
dir $logdir

./genPbList.sh testbird output.txt

cat output.txt | head -n 10
cat output.txt | tail -n 10

```

The code was then run on multiple files.

```{bash}
./genPbList.sh ZF1536 output.txt

cat output.txt | head -n 5
cat output.txt | tail -n 5
```
